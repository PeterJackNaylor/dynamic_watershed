dynamic_watershed
=================

Package description
--------------

We implement the splitting algorithm for splitting nuclei nucleas described in in 'Nuclei segmentation in histopathology images using deep neural networks'. This algorithm is essentially a dynamic watershed.
The main function is named: `post_process`.


Installation
--------------

dynamic_watershed can be installed by unzipping the source code in one directory and using this command: ::

    python setup.py install

You can also install it directly from the Python Package Index with this command (not working yet): :: 

    pip install dynamic_watershed

Example
--------------
